    "\n",
    "   * Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?\n",
    "   * Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background information:** \"Stock\" is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company, in general, and \"shares\" refers to a the ownership certificates of a particular company. When investors say they own stocks, they are generally referring to their overall ownership in one or more companies. The owners of [Stock and Shares](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/140.asp) earn money through the process of buying and trading stocks (trading). In addition, many of the more established stocks pay out a dividend quarterly, which can also provide the stockholder with an income.

    "### 3. Metrics\n",
    "In this section, you will need to clearly define the metrics or calculations you will use to measure performance of a model or result in your project. These calculations and metrics should be justified based on the characteristics of the problem and problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Are the metrics you’ve chosen to measure the performance of your models clearly discussed and defined?\n",
    "   * Have you provided reasonable justification for the metrics chosen based on the problem and solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure the performance of the model mainly I compared two arrays of values. The real values against the predictions from the model. Some of the metrics that I chose are: \n",
    "\n",
    "   1. **Mean Absolute Error**: The absolute error is the absolute value of the difference between the forecasted value and the actual value. MAE tells us how big of an error we can expect from the forecast on average.[More](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. **Mean Absolute Percent Error**: One problem with the MAE is that the relative size of the error is not always obvious. Sometimes it is hard to tell a big error from a small error. To deal with this problem, we can find the mean absolute error in percentage terms. [More](http://homepage.univie.ac.at/robert.kunst/prognos7.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. **Mean Absolute Deviation**: The Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD) of a set of data is the average distance between each data value and the mean. Helps to get a sense of how \"spread out\" a data set is. [More](http://mathbits.com/MathBits/TISection/Statistics1/MAD.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. **r2-score**: R^2 (coefficient of determination) is a statistical measure of how well the regression line approximates the real data points. Best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a R^2 score of 0.0.[More](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. **Spearman correlation**: Spearman's correlation coefficient, measures the strength of association between two ranked variables. If there are no repeated data values (which is the case), a perfect Spearman correlation of +1 or −1 occurs when each of the variables is a perfect monotone function of the other.[More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spearman's_rank_correlation_coefficient)\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. **metric#6**: It is the sum of the negative errors from the error list. The errors are the difference between the real values and the predicted values. [More](https://www.kaggle.com/forums/f/15/kaggle-forum/t/6270/what-s-the-best-way-to-measure-accuracy-significance-of-a-stock-prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "   7. **complement of metric#6**: It is the sum of the positive errors from the error list. The errors are the difference between the real values and the predicted values.[More](https://www.kaggle.com/forums/f/15/kaggle-forum/t/6270/what-s-the-best-way-to-measure-accuracy-significance-of-a-stock-prediction)\n",
    "\n",
    "   8. **Cumulative Forecast Error**: Cumulative gain/loss through the error. It is the sum of all the errors [More](http://www.threadpunter.com/supply-chain-management/demand-planning/measures-of-forecast-error/)\n",
    "\n",
    "   10. **average gain through error per stock price**: The average gain through the error in every prediction. It is the sum of the positive errors divided by the number of predictions made.\n",
    "\n",
    "   11. **average loss through error per stock price**: The average loss through the error in every prediction. It is the sum of the negative errors divided by the number of predictions made.\n",
    "\n",
    "   12. **average total gain/loss per stock price**: The average error in every prediction. It is the cumulative forecast error divided by the number of predictions made.\n",
    "\n",
    "   13. **Maximum loss (negative error)**: It is the lowest negative error, the lowest value from the error list.\n",
    "\n",
    "   14. **Maximun gain (positive error)**: It is the greatest positive error.\n",
    "\n",
    "   15. **Probability of negative error**: It is the probability of having negative errors.\n",

Because those days the [New York Stock Exchange](https://www.nyse.com/markets/hours-calendars) does not operate. This is important because whenever that happens the ANN model receives less input, the missing weights (wi) are substituted by the *default* values and the output (the prediction) is less accurate."

    "In this section, you will need to discuss the algorithms and techniques you intend to use for solving the problem. You should justify the use of each one based on the characteristics of the problem and the problem domain. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Are the algorithms you will use, including any default variables/parameters in the project clearly defined?\n",
    "   * Are the techniques to be used thoroughly discussed and justified?\n",

    "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have many different coefficients, which it can optimize. Hence, it can handle much more variability as compared to traditional models. Because of this they are commonly used in cases of image recognition and voice recognition. In cases of prediction ANNs tend to overfit. Still, when the training sets and testing sets are correctly distributed, the right activation functions are chosen as well as the number of neurons, Neural Networks are a powerful tool. Neural networks have been touted as all-powerful tools in stock-market prediction. Companies such as MJ Futures claim amazing 199.2% returns over a 2-year period using their neural network prediction methods.[Neural Networks](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/eroberts/courses/soco/projects/neural-networks/Applications/stocks.html)\n",

    "In the algorithms that I implement, the variables/parameters are weights. The input weights are the stock prices between two given dates, the start date and the end date (the end date is the current day).\n",

From the previous section, any of the abnormalities or characteristics that you identified about the dataset will be addressed and corrected here. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "   * If the algorithms chosen require preprocessing steps like feature selection or feature transformations, have they been properly documented?\n",

    "The algorithms chosen only require us to select a company and day. But based on the Data Exploration, the only abnormalities that need to be addressed and properly corrected are the **size of the dataset**. When the stock prices are pulled from *Yahoo Finance*, a smaller set can be received because there are stock prices registered only for work days. It means that without any modification, the predictions are based on sets of input data with different sizes because there are no stock prices registered during the weekends and also during holidays.

    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "   * Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?\n",

    "   * Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about the implementation of the algorithms and techniques given the input data, the Neural Network with three input neurons depends on 10 arrays of values passed per every prediction that we want to make (10 stock prices, previous days to the day that we want to predict). 5 of the values are preserved and the rest gets deleted; we use the most recent data first (check the function rollingWindow from optimized_analyzer.py. The input values substitute the default weights (wi) of the 3 input neurons; the 4th input neuron, the bias input neuron preserves the default weight. These 4 input neurons connect with 3 hidden neurons that were created when we created an object from the neuralNetwork class. The default weights of the hidden neurons are replaced with new values. This is called forward propagation. We forward propagate to get the output and compare it with the real value to get the error. Then, to minimize the error, we backward propagate by using a form of gradient descent (derivative of the sigmoid function) to update new values of weights (finding the derivative of the error with respect to each weight and then subtracting this value from the weight value. Check Line 255 from optimized_neuralNetwork.py). Then we forward propagate to see how well these weights are performing and backward propagate to update the weights. This iterative process will go on until we reach some minima for error value (or we can use the metrics to choose an optimal fixed number of iterations). In the end we get the last value to activate the output node of the Neural Network. Finally we denormalize the price using the minimum and maximum values from the 5 arrays of data (Line 131, 43, 261 from optimized_analyzer.py). It gives us the predicted stock price of the chosen date.\n",

Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "In this section, you will need to provide some form of visualization that emphasizes an important quality about the project. It is much more free-form, but should reasonably support a significant result or characteristic about the problem that you want to discuss. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Have you visualized a relevant or important quality about the problem, dataset, input data, or results?\n",
    "   * Is the visualization thoroughly analyzed and discussed?\n",
    "   * If a plot is provided, are the axes, title, and datum clearly defined?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond focusing only in the activity of the New York Stock Exchange, some relevant or important qualities about the problem that involve the input data and the results are the time zones and the trading times. Although the trading hours of the New York Stock Exchange market go from 9:30 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon (Eastern Time), there are stocks that happen before 9:30 a.m. and after 4 p.m. There are other exchanges across the globe, in other countries, other US cities, and even in New York itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "While in New York (USA - New York)  it is Thursday, May 5, 2016 at 9:30:00 AM EDT UTC-4 hours, in Saint-Petersburg (Russia - Saint Petersburg) it is Thursday, May 5, 2016 at 4:30:00 PM. It is clear to notice how the time zones play a special role in daily traiding. For this reason additional data can be selected and included as input data if one wishes to be more accurate predicting the stock price of the following day. Let's recall that a better prediction of the stock price for the following day prevents traders from paying more for stocks than they should. Normally morning time is when daily traders lose most money. [Why Morning Is the Worst Time to Trade Stocks](http://www.wsj.com/articles/early-birds-suffer-in-market-1442273794)."

You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",

    "   * Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was about predicting stock prices. I did it by creating an Artificial Neural Network. The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) learns from the input data and does multiple re-calibrations for each linkage weights.  The input weights of the ANN are the stock prices of the current day and the two previous days. The main functions used by the ANN are the activation function and the error function (this function helps to re-calibrate the weights). And of course the output of the ANN is the predicted stock price for the following day [How ANNs works](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/10/ann-work-simplified/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some interesting aspects of the project were realizing that Stock trading is a global matter and that predicting stock prices is a truly important matter for traders. It was amazing to find out that because of Time Zones, with the exception of the weekends, the Stock Marker never stops operating. Also, after studying the behavior of the Stock Market, I identified the volatility of the Stock Market as challenge in the task of predicting future daily stock prices. With this I mean that besides all metrics and numbers there are other big and important factors that are decisive in the future value of stocks. New technology can replace the current technology, which means that some companies will dissapear and new ones will be be brought to the market. For example: *Apple Inc., Google Inc., Samsung() and *other companies* that virtually(software) or physically(electronics) developed and improved Android and iOS platform technologies in the cellphones* replaced and took a big chunk of money from the digital camera and video camera companies like *Kodak* and others. Another example is how virtual streaming companies like *Netflix* replaced the service provided by *Blockbuster*, the physical rent of movies. More variables should be taken into account to predict stock prices with more accuracy. Doing that this model can be used in a general setting to predict daily stock prices."

    "### 15. Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?\n",
    "   * Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?\n",
    "   * If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques used in this project are decreasing having a number of activation functions implemented along with options for crossvalidation sets to achieve more accuracy on the dataset.[Stock Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~akar/IITK_website/EE671/report_stock.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Other algorithms that I did not implement but consider useful are: **Genetic algorithms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a trading rule may involve the use of parameters like Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD), Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Stochastics. A genetic algorithm would then input values into these parameters with the goal of maximizing net profit. Over time, small changes are introduced and those that make a desirably impact are retained for the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of genetic operations that can then be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Crossovers represent the reproduction and biological crossover seen in biology, whereby a child takes on certain characteristics of its parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Mutations represent biological mutation and are used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of a population to the next by introducing random small changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Selections are the stage at which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding (recombination or crossover).\n",
    "\n",
    "*These three operators are then used in a five-step process*:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **1st** Initialize a random population, where each chromosome is n-length, with n being the number of parameters. That is, a random number of parameters are established with n elements each.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **2nd** Select the chromosomes, or parameters, that increase desirable results (presumably net profit).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **3rd** Apply mutation or crossover operators to the selected parents and generate an offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **4th** Recombine the offspring and the current population to form a new population with the selection operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **5th** Repeat steps two to four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, this process will result in increasingly favorable chromosomes (or, parameters) for use in a trading rule. The process is then terminated when a stopping criteria is met, which can include running time, fitness, number of generations or other criteria.

Some parameters that can improve the accuracy of the model are [Eight Factors that Influence Day Trading](http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/29/market-timing-djia-pf-education-in_gc_0829investopedia_inl.html). Some ways to measure those eight factors that Influence Day Trading could be the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#1**, Overseas Market/Economic Action: Stock prices worldwide. [Find Information About Pre- And After-Hours Trading](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/preaftermarket.asp?partner=forbes-pf). If you see major negative activity in a \"foreign\" market that affects your sector, the prices of a stocks in that sector could fall. We could assign Factor#1 binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#2**, Economic Data: This is mostly expressed by \"interest rates\". For example, as interest rates in the U.K. rise, investors in that market may flee for better opportunities. Often, U.S. stocks will reap the benefit.[How Interest Rates affect the Stock Market](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/interestaffectsmarket.asp?partner=forbes-pf). Factor#2 can be measured using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#3**, Futures Data: [Index futures](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfutures.asp?partner=forbes-pf) cover the major market indexes. They start trading before the stock market and are a very good indicator of what the stock market opening will look like. The reason for this is that index futures prices are closely linked with the actual level of the Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA). [\"Are ETF Futures The Wave of The Future\"](http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/29/market-timing-djia-pf-education-in_gc_0829investopedia_inl.html). In other words Factor#3 can be measured by using the DJIA (a negative/positive numeric value/percentage)\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#4**, Buying At the Open: We can consider the difference between the opening stock prices and the average day stock price to estimate the maximum price of the stock. We can measure Factor#4 with a positive/negative percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#5**, Midday Trading Lull: When this happens, stocks can be purchased at a cheaper price at 1 p.m. than they could at, say, 11 a.m. Again, this is important to know, as this can affect both entry and exit points. Observing the stock price values at these hours of the day and compare it to the average day stock price can help us to better estimate the minimum value of the stock during the day. Factor#5 can be measured with a positive/negative percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#6**, Analyst Upgrades/Downgrades: We could classify the words from comments of top analysts. If an analyst mentions more words that backup Upgrades vs Downgrades we give the company a score of 1. In the opposite case we give it a score of 0. We count the sets of 1s and divide it by the number of analyst who reviewed the company. The highest score that could be achieved is 1. Then we will have to measure the correlation between the scores and the stock price value along different days. This way we can make it possible for the analysts to contribute in the prediction of stock prices. [What You Need to Know About Financial Analysts](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/041703.asp?partner=forbes-pf). Factor#6 can be measured using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#7**, Web-Related Articles: We can do the same than what we did for Factor#6 but only if the websites are reliable. First we should search which websites have a significant (massive) number of readers/viewers who trade in the Stock Market. Fector#7 will be measuring using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#8**, Friday Trading: Factor#8 can be helpful if we find that there is a correlation between the closing prices of Friday (numeric values) and the Analyst Upgrades/Downgrades during the weekend (binary values). Factor#8 can be measured by using that correlation. The [correlation coefficient](http://www.alcula.com/calculators/statistics/correlation-coefficient/), or Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PMCC) is a numerical value between -1 and 1 that expresses the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. When r is closer to 1 it indicates a strong positive relationship. This might be helpful to predict the opening stock prices on Mondays."
