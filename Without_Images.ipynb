    "In this section, look to provide a high-level overview of the project in layman’s terms. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Has an overview of the project been provided, such as the problem domain, project origin, and related datasets or input data?\n",
    "   * Has enough background information been given so that an uninformed reader would understand the problem domain and following problem statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Background information:** \"Stock\" is a general term used to describe the ownership certificates of any company, in general, and \"shares\" refers to a the ownership certificates of a particular company. When investors say they own stocks, they are generally referring to their overall ownership in one or more companies. The owners of [Stock and Shares](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/140.asp) earn money through the process of buying and trading stocks (trading). In addition, many of the more established stocks pay out a dividend quarterly, which can also provide the stockholder with an income.

Because of this they are commonly used in cases of image recognition and voice recognition. In cases of prediction ANNs tend to overfit. Still, when the training sets and testing sets are correctly distributed, the right activation functions are chosen as well as the number of neurons, Neural Networks are a powerful tool. Neural networks have been touted as all-powerful tools in stock-market prediction.

    "### 9. Implementation\n",
    "In this section, the process for which metrics, algorithms, and techniques that you implemented for the given data will need to be clearly documented. It should be abundantly clear how the implementation was carried out, and discussion should be made regarding any complications that occurred during this process. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Is it made clear how the algorithms and techniques were implemented with the given datasets or input data?\n",
    "   * Were there any complications with the original metrics or techniques that required changing prior to acquiring a solution?\n",
    "   * Was there any part of the coding process (e.g., writing complicated functions) that should be documented?\n",
    "\n",
    "Talking about the implementation of the algorithms and techniques given the input data, the technique (in this case Artifical Neural Networks) depends on 3 values passed (3 stock prices, the stock price of the chosen day and the stock prices of the 2 previous days). The 3 input values substitute the default weights (wi) of the 3 input neurons. These 3 input neurons connect with 2 hidden neurons, which means that after the values of the input neurons are modified using forward propagation, the default weights of the hidden neurons are replaced with new values. This is called forward propagation. We forward propagate to get the output and compare it with the real value to get the error. Then, to minimize the error, we backward propagate by using a form of gradient descent to update new values of weights (finding the derivative of the error with respect to each weight and then subtracting this value from the weight value). Then we forward propagate to see how well these weights are performing and backward propagate to update the weights. This iterative process will go on until we reach some minima for error value. The complications with the metrics to measure the performance of the model were not a lot. I chose the F1 score as my main metric because it conveys the balance between [precision and recall](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/evaluation-of-ranked-retrieval-results-1.html), thus avoiding overfitting. But could have considered the Absolute Error and the Absolute Percentage Error after implementing 5-K cross validation with the dataset-If the sets of input data were larger. In this case I choose an Artificial Neural Network with three neurons (the input data are three stock prices) because it is suggested.[Stock Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~akar/IITK_website/EE671/report_stock.pdf)."

For this reason additional data can be selected and included as input data if one wishes to be more accurate predicting the stock price of the following day. Let's recall that a better prediction of the stock price for the following day prevents traders from paying more for stocks than they should. Normally morning time is when daily traders lose most money. [Why Morning Is the Worst Time to Trade Stocks](http://www.wsj.com/articles/early-birds-suffer-in-market-1442273794)."

    "### 14. Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?\n",
    "   * Were there any interesting aspects of the project?\n",
    "   * Were there any difficult aspects of the project?\n",
    "   * Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was about predicting stock prices. I did it by creating an Artificial Neural Network. The ANN (Artificial Neural Network) learns from the input data and does multiple re-calibrations for each linkage weights.  The input weights of the ANN are the stock prices of the current day and the two previous days. The main functions used by the ANN are the activation function and the error function (this function helps to re-calibrate the weights). And of course the output of the ANN is the predicted stock price for the following day [How ANNs works](http://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2014/10/ann-work-simplified/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some interesting aspects of the project were realizing that Stock trading is a global matter and that predicting stock prices is a truly important matter for traders. It was amazing to find out that because of Time Zones, with the exception of the weekends, the Stock Marker never stops operating. Also, after studying the behavior of the Stock Market, the volatility of the Stock Market was a challenge that I identified. More variables should be taken into account to predict stock prices with more accuracy. Doing that this model can be used in a general setting to predict stock prices."

    "### 15. Improvement\n",
    "In this section, you will need to provide discussion as to how one aspect of the implementation you designed could be improved. As an example, consider ways your implementation can be made more general, and what would need to be modified. You do not need to make this improvement, but the potential solutions resulting from these changes are considered and compared/contrasted to your current solution. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Are there further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques you used in this project?\n",
    "   * Were there algorithms or techniques you researched that you did not know how to implement, but would consider using if you knew how?\n",
    "   * If you used your final solution as the new benchmark, do you think an even better solution exists?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the further improvements that could be made on the algorithms or techniques used in this project are decreasing the number of neurons to 3 neurons because \"A three layer neural network has been proved to be a universal function approximator and finds its use in a number of fields like sales forecasting, data validation, customer research, price forecasting, medicine, etc.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important improvement is that in this improved version there are a number of activation functions implemented along with options for crossvalidation sets to achieve more accuracy on the dataset.[Stock Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~akar/IITK_website/EE671/report_stock.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some other algorithms that I did not implement but consider useful are: **Genetic algorithms**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a trading rule may involve the use of parameters like Moving Average Convergence-Divergence (MACD), Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Stochastics. A genetic algorithm would then input values into these parameters with the goal of maximizing net profit. Over time, small changes are introduced and those that make a desirably impact are retained for the next generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of genetic operations that can then be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Crossovers represent the reproduction and biological crossover seen in biology, whereby a child takes on certain characteristics of its parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Mutations represent biological mutation and are used to maintain genetic diversity from one generation of a population to the next by introducing random small changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Selections are the stage at which individual genomes are chosen from a population for later breeding (recombination or crossover).\n",
    "\n",
    "*These three operators are then used in a five-step process*:\n",
    "\n",
    "   **1st** Initialize a random population, where each chromosome is n-length, with n being the number of parameters. That is, a random number of parameters are established with n elements each.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **2nd** Select the chromosomes, or parameters, that increase desirable results (presumably net profit).\n",
    "\n",
    "   **3rd** Apply mutation or crossover operators to the selected parents and generate an offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **4th** Recombine the offspring and the current population to form a new population with the selection operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **5th** Repeat steps two to four.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, this process will result in increasingly favorable chromosomes (or, parameters) for use in a trading rule. The process is then terminated when a stopping criteria is met, which can include running time, fitness, number of generations or other criteria.

    "A better solution can be adding more parameters to improve the model.

Some ways to measure those eight factors that Influence Day Trading could be the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#1**, Overseas Market/Economic Action: Stock prices worldwide. [Find Information About Pre- And After-Hours Trading](http://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/preaftermarket.asp?partner=forbes-pf). If you see major negative activity in a \"foreign\" market that affects your sector, the prices of a stocks in that sector could fall. We could assign Factor#1 binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#2**, Economic Data: This is mostly expressed by \"interest rates\". For example, as interest rates in the U.K. rise, investors in that market may flee for better opportunities. Often, U.S. stocks will reap the benefit.[How Interest Rates affect the Stock Market](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/06/interestaffectsmarket.asp?partner=forbes-pf). Factor#2 can be measured using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#3**, Futures Data: [Index futures](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/indexfutures.asp?partner=forbes-pf) cover the major market indexes. They start trading before the stock market and are a very good indicator of what the stock market opening will look like. The reason for this is that index futures prices are closely linked with the actual level of the Dow Jones industrial average (DJIA). [\"Are ETF Futures The Wave of The Future\"](http://www.forbes.com/2007/08/29/market-timing-djia-pf-education-in_gc_0829investopedia_inl.html). In other words Factor#3 can be measured by using the DJIA (a negative/positive numeric value/percentage)\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#4**, Buying At the Open: We can consider the difference between the opening stock prices and the average day stock price to estimate the maximum price of the stock. We can measure Factor#4 with a positive/negative percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#5**, Midday Trading Lull: When this happens, stocks can be purchased at a cheaper price at 1 p.m. than they could at, say, 11 a.m. Again, this is important to know, as this can affect both entry and exit points. Observing the stock price values at these hours of the day and compare it to the average day stock price can help us to better estimate the minimum value of the stock during the day. Factor#5 can be measured with a positive/negative percentage\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#6**, Analyst Upgrades/Downgrades: We could classify the words from comments of top analysts. If an analyst mentions more words that backup Upgrades vs Downgrades we give the company a score of 1. In the opposite case we give it a score of 0. We count the sets of 1s and divide it by the number of analyst who reviewed the company. The highest score that could be achieved is 1. Then we will have to measure the correlation between the scores and the stock price value along different days. This way we can make it possible for the analysts to contribute in the prediction of stock prices. [What You Need to Know About Financial Analysts](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/basics/03/041703.asp?partner=forbes-pf). Factor#6 can be measured using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#7**, Web-Related Articles: We can do the same than what we did for Factor#6 but only if the websites are reliable. First we should search which websites have a significant (massive) number of readers/viewers who trade in the Stock Market. Fector#7 will be measuring using binary values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Factor#8**, Friday Trading: Factor#8 can be helpful if we find that there is a correlation between the closing prices of Friday (numeric values) and the Analyst Upgrades/Downgrades during the weekend (binary values). Factor#8 can be measured by using that correlation. The [correlation coefficient](http://www.alcula.com/calculators/statistics/correlation-coefficient/), or Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient (PMCC) is a numerical value between -1 and 1 that expresses the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. When r is closer to 1 it indicates a strong positive relationship. This might be helpful to predict the opening stock prices on Mondays."
